The problem that I was solving in the projects for the course was using the correct (at least to me) data structure in implementing the course catalog. There was also creating data structures for loading bids and developing a menu for it. 
I approached the problem really with creating pseudocode and flowcharts - which helped in tackling things into bite-sized pieces.
Honestly, C++ is really not my strong suit at all, so I had my friend tutor me on some elements that I just wasn't comprehending.
I enjoy the work that I did, but as I'm not a fan of C++, I do want to challenge myself to convert this into Python or even Java.
I do feel my work has evolved as I'm not just thinking of how to make things work, but also a better way to make sure the runtime is fast when it comes to running software.
